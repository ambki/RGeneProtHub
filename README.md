# RGeneProtHub

To use the application:

1)  Install the library "reticulate" (<https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/>) to be able to use Python code in R. You can do it by using:

    ```         
    install.packages("reticulate")
    ```

2)  Clone the repository in your computer

3)  Open all the "py" files in R Studio Source all of them and one by one excepting "question_flow.py" (this can be done by using the upper right button from the left upper pane of RStudio -"Source Script"-)

4)  Run the whole file "question_flow.py".

And that's all! Just follow and answer the questions in the screen and you will get all the gene or protein information that you need.

ESSENTIAL requirement: the program does not run without an active internet connection, so please make sure that you are connected.
