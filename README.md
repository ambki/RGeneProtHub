# RGeneProtHub

To use the application:

1)  Clone the repository in your computer
2)  Open all the "py" files in R Studio and source all of them and one by one excepting "question_flow.py" (this can be done by using the upper right button from this R studio pane -"Source Script"-)
3)  Run the whole file "question_flow.py".

And that's all! Just follow and answer the questions in the screen and you will get all the gene or protein information that you need.

ESSENTIAL requirement: the program does not run without an active internet connection, so please make sure that you are connected.
